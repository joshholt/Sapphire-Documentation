The source for this site is held within a [git repository][]. To add your own documentation to this site, simply clone the repository, add your documents, commit your changes, then push to your master.
Once you have followed the procedure above your additions will be available for everyone to take advantage.

## Examples of useful documentation

A few examples of things that would be useful:

* Project Workflow and Timelines
* Details about the project's version control process
* Various IBIS Matrices
* Use-cases
* Requirements
* DAG's
* Meeting Transcripts/ Whiteboard photos...
* Generated Source Code documentation (Maybe??)
* etc...

I have already added documentation for the _Single Committer Model_ using Git. It can be found [here][].

So, if you have something to contribute please feel free to help the enterprise project's knowledge base grow.
